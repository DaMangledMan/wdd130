        Additional Paragraph: Growing up, cooking with my mom wasn't just about preparing meals; it was a sacred ritual. Her gentle guidance, her infectious laughter, and her unwavering patience turned the kitchen into a haven of love and learning. We'd spend hours chopping vegetables, stirring sauces, and baking treats, sharing stories and dreams as we worked. These shared experiences shaped my palate, my cooking skills, and my understanding of food as a language of love. Now, as I navigate the challenges of college life, I find solace in the memories of those cozy kitchen moments. They remind me of the warmth of family, the comfort of home, and the simple joy of sharing a meal with loved ones.

      <h3>Butter Beer Recipe</h3>
      <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <p>
        1 c. Brown Sugar | 1/2 tsp. Salt | 2 TBL. Water | 1/2 tsp. Cider Vinegar | 6 TBL. Butter | 3/4 c. Heavy Cream, divided | 1/2 tsp. Rum Extract | 4-8 12 oz. Cans of Cream Soda
      </p>
      <h4>instructions</h4>
      <p>
        In a small saucepan over med heat, combine the brown sugar and water. Bring to a gentle boil and cook, stirring often, until the mixture reads 240 F. on a candy thermometer. Stir in the butter, salt, vinegar and 1/4 heavy cream. Set aside to cool to room temperature. Once the mixture has cooled, stir in the rum extract. In a med bowl, combine 2 TBL. of the brown sugar mixture and the remaining 1/2 c. of heavy cream. Use and electric mixer to beat until just thickened, but not completely whipped, about 2-3 min. To serve, divide the brown sugar mixture between 4-8 tall glasses, (about 1/4 c. for each glass, or less). Add 1/4 c. of cream soda to each glass, then stir to combine. Fill each glass nearly to the top with additional cream soda, then spoon the whipped topping over each. *My family has found that the 1/4 c. of brown sugar mix is too much for our family. We do about half, maybe a little more. We have also found that the name brand sodas have WAY to much sugar added and therefore are too sweet. Use an off brand if you can or one that has a slightly less sugary taste.
